And this works well for columns that have only two categories present, like for example, the `sex` column. But for columns that contain more than two categories this method may or may not work. The main problem here is that after the categories are converted to numbers, machine learning algorithms typically treat numbers algebraically, so the order of the numerical values encoding different categories becomes extremely important. And sometimes, this is what we want. For example, there is a clear sense of order in the `class` column of the Titanic data set: the first calss is better than the second and the second clas is better than the third in many respects that are relevant for the classification model we are trying to build. For example, the first class passengers had easier and faster access to the lifeboats, the first class area was not as crowded as those for the second and thirds classes, just to name a few. On the other hand, there is no clear sense of mathematical order for the categories present in the `who` or `embark_town` column: for those columns the integer values representing different categories are just numbers whose relative sizes do not matter. For this reason it might be counterproductive to use ordinal encoding for those columns. For categories that do not represent any ordinal relationship we typically use a so-called *one-hot encoding*, when every category is represented by a new binary column. Let's take a look at an example illustrating how one-hot encoding works. There are a couple of ways to do it. Let's start with the Pandas library.
